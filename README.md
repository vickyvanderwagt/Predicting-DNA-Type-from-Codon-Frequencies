Description:
Codon usage frequencies in genomic coding deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) are essential indicators of evolutionary processes and genetic diversity among organisms. This study analyzed a comprehensive dataset comprising codon usage across different organisms from various taxa to predict the DNA type of organisms and classify them into one of 12 distinct categories. Seven models were generated; XG Boost performed best, with an accuracy of 98.89%. Performance exceeded baseline accuracy of 71.14%.

Categories:
* Genomic
* Mitochondrial
* Chloroplast
* Plastid
* Kinetoplast
* Cyanelle
* Nucleomorph
* Apicoplast
* Secondary_endosymbiont
* Chromoplast
